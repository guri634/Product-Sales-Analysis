# Product-Sales-Analysis

Hi, I performed Sales Analysis for a Hypothetical business.
You can download the data [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms)

The Sales Manager shared a business request and want me to answer some business questions mentioned in the word docs.

After downloading the raw data from the above link, I cleaned it and fetched only necessary data. For data cleansing, I used Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft SQL Management Studio. I performed data modelling and wrote some SQL queries to get the necessary data only.
