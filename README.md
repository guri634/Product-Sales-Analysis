# Sales Analysis for a Hypothetical Bike Company
This project presents a sales analysis conducted for a hypothetical business that sells bikes, clothing, and accessories. The purpose of the analysis is to provide insights into the company's sales performance and answer specific business questions posed by the Sales Manager.

## Data Preprocessing
Before conducting the analysis, the raw data was processed and cleaned to extract only the necessary information. Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft SQL Management Studio were utilized for data cleansing tasks. This involved performing data modeling and writing SQL queries to obtain the required dataset.

The Sales Manager provided a set of business questions that needed to be answered through the analysis. To address these questions, three interactive dashboards were created. Power BI was employed to develop these dashboards, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to create relevant measures.


## Key Findings
The analysis yielded several key findings, including:

* Bikes constitute the majority of sales, indicating their high demand.
* December emerged as the month with the highest sales volume.
* Road Bikes and Mountain Bikes garnered the most customer interest.
* The Mountain-200 bike model generated the highest sales among all the products.
